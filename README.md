This project is a Hotel Booking System developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to search and book hotel rooms by selecting their desired destination, start and end dates, and filtering results based on room prices. The user-friendly interface ensures a seamless booking experience. On the admin side, the dashboard allows for the easy addition and management of hotel details and room availability, ensuring efficient room booking management. This application provides an efficient solution for both hotel customers and administrators to manage bookings and hotel data effectively.
